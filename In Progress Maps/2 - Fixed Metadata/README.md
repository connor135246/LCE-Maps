### Fixed Metadata Details
 - There are some blocks that have weird metadata. In Legacy Console Edition, they appear to work fine and usually just appear as the default metadata for the block. However, when opened in Java Edition, they get converted to air. 
 - The maps in this section have had their weird metadata blocks fixed.
   - First, an MCEdit filter was used to automatically set the weird metadata blocks to their default metadata.  
   - Then, blocks with different variations (such as planks) or orientations (such as torches) were manually checked and fixed if necessary.
