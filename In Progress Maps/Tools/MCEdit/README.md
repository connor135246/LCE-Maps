## MCEdit 
 Stuff to do with MCEdit Unified 1.5.6
 
### pymclevel/minecraft.json & terrain.png
 - Added Observers, Glazed Terracotta, Concrete, Concrete Powder, and Shulker Boxes
   - I was a little lazy about it, so Glazed Terracotta textures don't rotate with their metadata and Shulker Box textures are the same on every side. Also, map colors are copy-pasted from Wool map colors. It's good enough for now.
 - Updated the name of Hardened Clay and Stained Clay to Terracotta and Stained Terracotta, like in 1.12
 - Add missing metadata for Purpur Slabs
 
### stock-filters
 - MCEdit filters.
