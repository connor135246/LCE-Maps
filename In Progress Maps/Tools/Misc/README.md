## Misc
 
### level.dat
 Things to copy-paste into your level.dat.  
 Contains:  
 - A bunch of gamerules already set. Stuff like randomTickSpeed being set to 0 to prevent vines from growing, doMobSpawning set to false, and everything else you want to keep the world as unchanging as possible.
 - A customized superflat generation string. It's the same as the default superflat, but without villages.
